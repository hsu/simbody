# Build and install examples.
#
# This is for use when building Simbody from source; it is not for
# end users to build examples themselves. This guarantees that the 
# examples built with Simbody are using the libraries just built regardless
# of what is installed. We install a different CMakeLists.txt along with
# the examples for end users to use.
#
# Examples are built from an explicit list of subdirectories given below,
# and then simpler examples are built one per .cpp file in the top level
# examples directory. If your example needs more than just a single .cpp
# with a single .h of the same name, then put it in its own subdirectory 
# where it can have its own CMakeLists.txt. You must list those
# subdirectories explicitly below; the simpler ones will be discovered
# automatically.
#
# Examples get built with these macros defined:
#    SIMBODY_EXAMPLE_NAME     
#    SIMBODY_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_SRC  (has trailing "/")
# Subdirectory examples should locate their auxiliary files by searching
# for one file, say "geometry/pelvis.stl", using this search path:
#    .  (current directory first)
#    ./examples/${SIMBODY_EXAMPLE_NAME}
#    ${SIMBODY_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_SRC}${SIMBODY_EXAMPLE_NAME}
#
# There is also a "shared" directory that has shared header files for
# the examples, but also may contain shared auxiliary files like common
# geometric shapes. In that case it must also be located at run time
# using the search path:
#    ../shared   (parallel to current directory first)
#    ./examples/shared
#    ${SIMBODY_EXAMPLES_INSTALL_SRC}shared
#
# Examples can depend on any Simbody includes, and may depend on headers
# in the examples/shared directory, in which case they should be
# included as #include "shared/SharedHeaderFile.h". This also permits use 
# of headers between examples, via #include "OtherExample/SomeHeader.h",
# although it is not clear that's a good idea.
# 
# Note that unlike code in the "tests" directory (but like the 
# "tests/adhoc" code), this does not generate CMake ADD_TEST commands so 
# these will never run automatically.
#
# For IDEs that can deal with PROJECT_LABEL properties (at least
# Visual Studio) the projects for building each of these adhoc
# executables will be labeled "Example - TheExampleName" if a file
# TheExampleName.cpp is found in this directory, or if we build from 
# a subdirectory called TheExampleName.
#
# We check the BUILD_TESTS_AND_EXAMPLES_{SHARED,STATIC} variables to 
# determine whether to build dynamically linked, statically linked, or both
# versions of the executable.

# All subdirectory examples must be listed here.  A subdirectory is needed 
# for any example that consists of more than just one source file and one 
# header file.
